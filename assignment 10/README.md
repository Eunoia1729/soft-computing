# Assignment - 10

In this assignment, we were asked to implement a soft margin-SVM with RBF Kernel using SMO algorithm.

To train and predict, head disease dataset was used which consisted of 303 samples and 2 features in total were used for this model. The labels were converted to 1 and -1 from 1 and 0 and feature scaling was done for the data samples.
